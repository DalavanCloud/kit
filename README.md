# Kubernetes Integration Testing

As systems grow, integration testing is not easy to get right and the complexity of Kubernetes definitely makes things harder. We want to change that!

We are looking to start a conversation in the open with teams that are running or planning to run their systems on Kubernetes and facing integration testing and end-to-end testing problems.

What are your major pain points? If you had a magic wand that could create magical integration test solutions - what features would you like to see? Open a ticket! Spread the word! Let's have a conversation!

# What is this repo?

This is a "teaser" repository where you can let your voices heard and we can use it as a source of real feedback from the community around real needs.

We will not have code here (at least for a while) but we will have proposals and discussions (issues).

The process is simple:

- open an issue to start a discussion around an idea, your use case or a problem definition
- if the discussion identifies a clear use case - we will collect it in `use-cases/` folder

Structure of the repo:

```
use-cases\
README.md - this file
```


# When can we see some real software?

In 2019 :)
